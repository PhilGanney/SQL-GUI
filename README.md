# SQL GUI
 Design databases and get the SQL to create those designs. Primarily as MySQL, though for the SQL this will generate the differences won't be vast.
 SQL = Structured Query Language
 GUI = Graphical User Interface
 
 ## MVP in early development
   ### Started 6th January 2022, as part of my design/development portfolio
  SQL GUI is not yet functional, and I'm only planning on working on this for a week or so.
 
  There are many features that this could have, but this will only have the core features, at least for the foreseable future. 
  Once the core functionality is working and looking good, I won't be focussing on this project.
